Saves Real Estate agents 40+ minutes on creating listings while harnessing power of generative ai to increase variety of potential buyers with different writing styles.  

#The Process for a realty agent would be:

A realtor fills out the form with the property details.

They click "Generate AI Listings."

The app uses the Gemini API to create unique listing descriptions.

The realtor can then use the "Copy" button on each generated listing to copy the text to their clipboard.

They can then paste the copied text directly into their CRM, MLS (Multiple Listing Service) system, or other marketing platforms (like Zillow or Redfin).

The "Export All" button is also there to simplify this. It allows the realtor to download a single .txt file containing all the generated listings, which can be useful for saving a record of the generated content or for sharing it with a team.
